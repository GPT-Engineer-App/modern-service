# modern-service

A landing page for a SaaS (Software as a Service) business. The page should have a modern, clean design, featuring a hero section with a prominent call-to-action (CTA) button, sections for services offered, customer testimonials, a pricing table, and a contact form. The color scheme should be professional, using blues and whites, with a sleek, sans-serif font.
